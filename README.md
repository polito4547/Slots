# Slots
## Description
Slots game that runs in the terminal.

## Summary
The game is a simple version of slots, opting to use the Random python module instead of building more accurate reels found in an actual slots machine. The main focus of this project was to learn the basics of python and explore some basic user input.

## Modifications
This application was originally a project created by [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I). After completing his project, I decided to add a bit more user functionality, such as adding a simple player profile option that the game can save and load so that the "money" doesn't magically vanish between the times the player opens and closes the app. I also added the ability to break out of the betting prompt, in case the player realize that they don't have enough money to bet the amount that they want to.
